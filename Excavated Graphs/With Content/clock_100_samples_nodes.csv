mathematics,en,s,"Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself.  There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics)."
Rotation period (astronomy),en,s,"In astronomy, the rotation period or spin period of a celestial object (e. g. , star, planet, moon, asteroid) has two definitions.  The first one corresponds to the sidereal rotation period (or sidereal day), i. e. , the time that the object takes to complete a full rotation around its axis relative to the background stars (inertial space)."
Cauchy sequence,en,s,"In mathematics, a Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.  More precisely, given any small positive distance, all excluding a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.  Cauchy sequences are named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy; they may occasionally be known as fundamental sequences. It is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the preceding term."
42nd Street (Manhattan),en,s,"42nd Street is a major crosstown street in the New York City borough of Manhattan, spanning the entire breadth of Midtown Manhattan, from  Turtle Bay at the East River, to Hell's Kitchen at the Hudson River on the West Side.

Moon,en,s,"Soon is a rock opera with music by Joseph M.  Kookoolis and Scott Fagan, lyrics by Fagan, and a book by Martin Duberman and Robert Greenwald.  It is based on a story by Fagan and Kookoolis. The story is about a group of young musicians who achieve success in New York City, but pay the price.  It was an attack on the record industry, which apparently caused Fagan and Kookoolis to be blacklisted."

invention,en,s,"An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition, idea or process.  An invention may be an improvement upon a machine, product, or process for increasing efficiency or lowering cost.  It may also be  an entirely new concept.  If an idea is unique enough either as a stand-alone invention or as a significant improvement over the work of others, it can be patented."
thermodynamic processes,en,s,"Classical thermodynamics considers three main kinds of thermodynamic processes: (1) changes in a system, (2) cycles in a system,  and (3) flow processes. (1) A Thermodynamic process is a process in which the thermodynamic state of a system is changed.  A change in a system is defined by a passage from an initial to a final state of thermodynamic equilibrium.  In classical thermodynamics, the actual course of the process is not the primary concern, and often is ignored."
essence,en,s,"Essence (Latin: essentia) has various meanings and uses for different thinkers and in different contexts.  It is used in philosophy and theology as a designation for the property or set of properties or attributes that make an entity the entity it is or, expressed negatively, without which it would lose its identity.  Essence is contrasted with accident, which is a property or attribute the entity has accidentally or contingently, but upon which its identity does not depend."

speed of light,en,s,"The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant that is exactly equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 300,000 kilometres per second; 186,000 miles per second; 671 million miles per hour).  According to the special theory of relativity, c is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy (and thus any signal carrying information) can travel through space."
reality,en,s,
event (philosophy),en,s,"In philosophy, events are objects in time or instantiations of properties in objects.  On some views, only changes in the form of acquiring or losing a property can constitute events, like the lawn's becoming dry.  According to others, there are also events that involve nothing but the retaining of a property, e. g.  the lawn's staying wet.  Events are usually defined as particulars that, unlike universals, cannot repeat at different times."
future,en,s,"Culture ( KUL-chər) is a concept that encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, attitude, and habits of the individuals in these groups.  Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location. Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies."
priority date,en,s,"Priority date is a United States immigration concept – it is the date when a principal applicant first reveals his or her intent of immigration to the US government.  For family-sponsored applicants, the priority date is the date an immigration petition, filed on behalf of him or her, is received by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)."

novelty (patent),en,s,"Novelty is one of the patentability requirement for a patent claim, whose purpose is to prevent issuing patents on known things, i. e.  to prevent public knowledge from being taken away from the public domain. An invention is anticipated (i. e.  not new) and therefore not patentable if it was known to the public before the priority date of the patent application.  Although the concept of ""novelty"" in patent law appears simple and self-explanatory, this view is very far from reality."
order theory,en,s,"Order theory is a branch of mathematics that investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations.  It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as ""this is less than that"" or ""this precedes that"".  This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions.  A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the order theory glossary.  Background and motivation Orders are everywhere in mathematics and related fields like computer science."
Set (mathematics),en,s,"In mathematics, a set is a collection of different things; these things are called elements or members of the set and are typically mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets.   A set may have a finite number of elements or be an infinite set.  There is a unique set with no elements, called the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton."
Sun,en,s,"A son is a male offspring; a boy or a man in relation to his parents.  The female counterpart is a daughter.   From a biological perspective, a son constitutes a first degree relative.  Social issues In pre-industrial societies and some current countries with agriculture-based economies, a higher value was, and still is, assigned to sons rather than daughters, giving males higher social status, because males were physically stronger, and could perform farming tasks more effectively."
Universals (metaphysics),en,s,"In metaphysics, a universal is what particular things have in common, namely characteristics or qualities.  In other words, universals are repeatable or recurrent entities that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things.  For example, suppose there are two chairs in a room, each of which is green.  These two chairs share the quality of ""chairness"", as well as ""greenness"" or the quality of being green; in other words, they share two ""universals""."
Power (physics),en,s,"Power is the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit time.  In the International System of Units, the unit of power is the watt, equal to one joule per second.  Power is a scalar quantity. Specifying power in particular systems may require attention to other quantities; for example, the power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the aerodynamic drag plus traction force on the wheels, and the velocity of the vehicle."
phase transition,en,s,"In physics, chemistry, and other related fields like biology, a phase transition (or phase change) is the physical process of transition between one state of a medium and another.  Commonly the term is used to refer to changes among the basic states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas, and in rare cases, plasma.  A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform physical properties."

thermodynamics,en,s,"Thermodynamics deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation.  The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics.  Thermodynamics plays a role in a wide variety of topics in science and engineering."
Praeneste fibula,en,s,"The Praeneste fibula (the ""brooch of Palestrina"") is a golden fibula or brooch, today housed in the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome.

At the time of its discovery in the late nineteenth century, it was accepted as the earliest known specimen of the Latin language."
full moon,en,s,The full moon is the lunar phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective.  This occurs when Earth is located between the Sun and the Moon (when the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180°).  This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth—the near side—is completely sunlit and appears as an approximately circular disk.  The full moon occurs roughly once a month.
list of online dictionaries,en,s,"An online dictionary is a dictionary that is accessible via the Internet through a web browser.

The observatory is located in Northwest Washington, D. C."
reference work,en,s,"A reference work is a  work, such as a paper, book or periodical (or their electronic equivalents), to which one can refer for information.  The information is intended to be found quickly when needed.  Such works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end.  The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid opinions and the use of the first person, and emphasize facts."
particulars,en,s,"In metaphysics, particulars or individuals are usually contrasted with universals.  Universals concern features that can be exemplified by various different particulars.  Particulars are often seen as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers.  There are, however, theories of abstract particulars or tropes.  For example, Socrates is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e. g."
patentability,en,s,"Within the context of a national or multilateral body of law, an invention is patentable if it meets the relevant legal conditions to be granted a patent.

The is the most frequently used word in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words."
existence,en,s,"Existence is the state of having being or reality in contrast to nonexistence and nonbeing.  Existence is often contrasted with essence: the essence of an entity is its essential features or qualities, which can be understood even if one does not know whether the entity exists. Ontology is the philosophical discipline studying the nature and types of existence.  Singular existence is the existence of individual entities while general existence refers to the existence of concepts or universals."

Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation."
Property (philosophy),en,s,"In logic and philosophy (especially metaphysics), a property is a characteristic of an object; a red object is said to have the property of redness.  The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties.  A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be instantiated, and often in more than one object."
Rotation around a fixed axis,en,s,"Rotation around a fixed axis or axial rotation is a special case of rotational motion around an axis of rotation fixed, stationary, or static in three-dimensional space.  This type of motion excludes the possibility of the instantaneous axis of rotation changing its orientation and cannot describe such phenomena as wobbling or precession."

The cognitive features include a wide spectrum of cognitive functions, such as perception biases, memory recall, comprehension and high-level mental constructs (such as meaning attribution and categories) and performance on various cognitive tasks (reasoning or judgment)."
calendar,en,s,"A calendar is a system of organizing days.  This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years.  A date is the designation of a single and specific day within such a system.  A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system.  A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar, or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills."
lunar phase,en,s,"A lunar phase or Moon phase is the apparent shape of the Moon's directly sunlit portion as viewed from the Earth (because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, the same hemisphere is always facing the Earth).  In common usage, the four major phases are the new moon, the first quarter, the full moon and the last quarter; the four minor phases are waxing crescent, waxing gibbous, waning gibbous, and waning crescent."
evolutionary robotics,en,s,"Evolutionary robotics is an embodied approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in which robots are automatically designed using Darwinian principles of natural selection.  The design of a robot, or a subsystem of a robot such as a neural controller, is optimized against a behavioral goal (e. g.  run as fast as possible)."
central business district,en,s,"A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business center of a city.  It contains commercial space and offices, and in larger cities will often be described as a financial district.  Geographically, it often coincides with the ""city centre"" or ""downtown"".  However, these concepts are not necessarily synonymous: many cities have a central business district located away from its traditional city center, and there may be multiple CBDs within a single urban area."
George Merriam,en,s,"George Merriam (; January 20, 1803 –  June 22, 1880) was an American publisher.  With his brother Charles, he founded G.  and C.  Merriam, which would eventually become Merriam-Webster, Inc. The Merriam family were printers, book manufacturers, and booksellers in Worcester County in the latter part of the 18th century."
rotation,en,s,"Rotation or rotational motion is the circular movement of an object around a central line, known as an axis of rotation.  A plane figure can rotate in either a clockwise or counterclockwise sense around a perpendicular axis intersecting anywhere inside or outside the figure at a center of rotation.  A solid figure has an infinite number of possible axes and angles of rotation, including chaotic rotation (between arbitrary orientations), in contrast to rotation around a fixed axis."
