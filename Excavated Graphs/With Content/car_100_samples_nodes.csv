Invention The first wheel to use the tension in metal spokes was invented by Sir George Cayley to achieve lightness in his 1853 glider."
Benz Patent-Motorwagen,en,s,"The Benz Patent-Motorwagen (""patent motorcar""), built in 1885 by the German Karl Benz, is widely regarded as the first practical modern automobile and was the first car put into production.  It was patented in January 1886 and unveiled in public later that year.  The original cost of the vehicle was 600 imperial German marks, approximately 150 US dollars (equivalent to $5,100 in 2023)."
mechanical energy,en,s,"In  physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy.  The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant.  If an object moves in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase; and if the speed (not the velocity) of the object changes, the kinetic energy of the object also changes."

Daihatsu Applause,en,s,"The Daihatsu Applause (Japanese: ダイハツ・アプローズ, Daihatsu Apurōzu) is a compact car (C-segment in Europe) manufactured by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu for British and Australian markets.  The Daihatsu Applause was manufactured from 1989 to 2000.  It is most notable for its unusual body style, which, despite appearing to be a 4-door notchback sedan, is in fact a 5-door liftback with a notchback-shaped 412-litre trunk and a tailgate."

automobile,en,s,"A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels.  Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo.  There are around one billion cars in use worldwide.  The car is considered an important part of the developed economy."
Car,en,s,"The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.  It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.  Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.  It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact."
electric bicycle,en,s,"An electric bicycle, e-bike, electrically assisted pedal cycle, or electrically power assisted cycle is a motorized bicycle with an integrated electric motor used to assist propulsion.  Many kinds of e-bikes are available worldwide, but they generally fall into two broad categories: bikes that assist the rider's pedal-power (i. e.  pedelecs) and bikes that add a throttle, integrating moped-style functionality."
Kiichiro Toyoda,en,s,"Kiichiro Toyoda (Japanese: 豊田 喜一郎（とよだ きいちろう）, Hepburn: Toyoda Kiichirō, June 11, 1894 – March 27, 1952) was a Japanese businessman and the son of Toyoda Loom Works founder Sakichi Toyoda.  His decision to change Toyoda's focus from automatic loom manufacture into automobile manufacturing created what later became Toyota Motor Corporation."

electric motor,en,s,"An electric motor is a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.  Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft.  An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in reverse, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy."
aircraft,en,s,"An aircraft (pl. : aircraft) is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air.  It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or, in a few cases, direct downward thrust from its engines.  Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons. The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation."
Lubricant,en,s,"Lubrication is the process or technique of using a lubricant to reduce friction and wear and tear in a contact between two surfaces.  The study of lubrication is a discipline in the field of tribology. Lubrication mechanisms such as fluid-lubricated systems are designed so that the applied load is partially or completely carried by hydrodynamic or hydrostatic pressure, which reduces solid body interactions (and consequently friction and wear)."
fossil fuels,en,s,"A fossil fuel is a carbon compound- or hydrocarbon-containing material formed naturally in the Earth's crust from the buried remains of prehistoric organisms (animals, plants or planktons), a process that occurs within geological formations."
